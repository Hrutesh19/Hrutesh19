### 👋 Hello, I'm Hrutesh Ghodmare



🛠️ My journey into the world of software development began with a love for problem-solving, and it's evolved into a deep-seated curiosity about cutting-edge tech. I've had the privilege of interning at DRDO under the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) in their RADAR System Lab, where I contributed to groundbreaking research.

📚 My research interests include Foliage Penetration Radar Systems and Image Processing Algorithms for Foliage Target Detection and Classification. You can explore my publications here:
- [Comprehensive Review of Foliage Penetration Radar Systems]()
